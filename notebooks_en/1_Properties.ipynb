    "This is the first in a series of lessons on using Python for undergraduate Thermodynamics.  Thermodynamics is the study of how energy is transferred between different forms of matter.  Engineers use Thermodynamics to design systems and processes that produce something useful - for example, electrical energy or heat - in the most efficient way possible.  Nuclear power plants, air conditioners, and your car's engine are all examples of thermodynamic processes that produce energy that we use in our everyday lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the course of these lessons, we will study several *cumulative design examples*, each motivated by a specific need.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How do you design an efficient system for keeping your house at room temperature when the outdoor temperature fluctuates?\n",
    "1. How do you efficiently convert the heat produced by burning fossil fuels into useable electricity and/or mechanical work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in each scenario, we are interested in efficiency.  There are many designs capable of doing either task, but for the sake of the environment (and the almighty dollar), we want to reduce the amount of waste as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following figure shows a typical system studied in Thermodynamics:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/vapor cycle.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the lower left corner, liquid water is pumped up to high pressure, where it can be boiled very efficiently.  The steam that is produced is used to drive a turbine (a series of fan blades) that can be used to make electricity.  The steam is condensed back to liquid water by cooling it using cold river water.  The liquid water is then pumped again, repeating the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that is is much easier to pump liquid water than steam, so more energy is produced by the turbine than used by the pump, thus producing net energy.  The heat needed to boil the water comes from burning fossil fuels, nuclear fission, or solar heating, just to name a few.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to this diagram many times throughout these lessons.  It shows in a very general setting how heat in and out can be transformed into work in and out.  Air conditioners, nuclear power plants, and car engines all have these features in common; only the details vary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to designing a thermodynamic system is to be able to determine how energy is stored in various substances, like gasoline, refrigerants, and pressurized steam, and what processes can best extract this energy."

    "**Thermodynamic properties** are any characteristics or parameters used to describe a substance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of familiar properties are Temperature $T$, Pressure $P$, mass $m$, volume $V$, and density $\\rho$.  Properties that scale in proportion to mass are called extensive.  Those that do not change if mass is changed are called **intensive**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to visualize the difference between extensive and intensive properties is to imaging a block of matter with uniform properties (every spatial point in the block looks the same).  If the block is cut in half, which properties are also cut in half, and which ones remain the same?  The following figure shows some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/extensive vs intensive.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, if you cut the block in half, each half will have half the mass and volume of the original.  Thus, *mass and volume are extensive properties*.  However, this means the *density* of the two pieces remains unchanged, since density is the ratio of mass and volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} = \\dfrac{\\frac{1}{2}m}{\\frac{1}{2}V}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, *density is an intensive property*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Temperature and pressure are related to the average kinetic energy and momentum of the particles that make up the block.  Since these are averages, and the left half of the block is the same as the right half, they must also be the same within each half.  Therefore, *temperature and pressure are also intensive properties*."
