    "We will start with simple example to review what we've covered so far concerning energy balanace: how does energy enter and leave a system, and how does the stored energy in the system change as a result.  First of all, what do we mean by \"system\"?  What we technically mean is a **control system**, which consists of a fixed group of particles.  So the mass of a control system is constant, while its other properties (pressure, temperature, volume, etc.) may vary during a thermodynamic process.  The following diagram depicts a constrol system of gas inside a cylinder:\n",

    "<img src=\"../images/piston cylinder control system.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary of the control system is the **control boundary**.  No mass is allowed to pass through this boundary, so it moves with the piston as it goes up and down.  On the other hand, energy is allowed to pass through in the form of heat transfer and work.  As the arrows indicate, there may be energy entering and leaving the boundary simultaneously.  For example, work enters the system through the fan agitating the gas (thus adding to its stored energy), and work leaves the system by pushing the piston upward (doing work on it).  Any or all of these terms may be 0 of course.\n",
