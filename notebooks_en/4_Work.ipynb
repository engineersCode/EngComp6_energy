However, there is usually a force that resists this motion: it may be gravity, an elastic membrane, a spring, or a mechanical linkage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with something simple and familiar, a linear spring.  It's force-displacement curve is a straight line given by $F(x) = -kx$, where $F$ is the force the spring exerts, $x$ is its displacement from its relaxed length, and $k$ is the spring constant, which is just the proportional relationship between $F$ and $x$.  The negative sign indicates that the spring \"resists\" being deformed; it exerts a force in the opposite direction of its deflection.\n",

    "**Example:** The piston inside a tire pressure gauge is pushed from $x_1 = 0.02 m$ to $x_2 = 0.15m$, where we assume $x=0$ is the position at which the spring is relaxed.  The spring constant is measured to be $k = 10 N/m$.  Calculate how much work is done on the piston by the compressed air on its left.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we calculated the work output of a moving piston while the gas moving it was going through a thermodynamic cycle.  In physics this is often called **moving boundary work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lesson, we simulated the conduction of heat through the boundary of a cooler full of cold air.  To review, heat conduction is the mechanism by which heat is transfered between two systems at rest relative to each other, where one system is at a higher temperature than the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a piston-cylinder setup filled with a refrigerated air placed in a room.  As you would expect, the temperature of the air in the vessel will gradually increase until it matches the room's air temperature.  The air temperature of the room will decrease ever so slightly, but we can assume this effect is negligible.  As heat is transfered to the system, the piston will slowly rise as the air heats up.  The main difference between this example and the one in the previous lesson is that the air in this example is at a constant pressure; whereas in the previous example it was at a constant volume.\n",

    "$0 = \\sum F = P_{sys}A - P_{atm}A$\n",

    "\n",
    "For heat conduction, we make the usual assumption that he rate at which heat transfered can be well approximated by [Fourier's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier's_law):\n",
