    "In the previous lesson, we saw how the specific volume of water varies with temperature and pressure.  Notably, there is a large jump in the specific volume when the water transitions from a liquid to a vapor.  This change occurs over a very small temperature range; in fact, the temperature of water is almost constant during the entire boiling process.\n",
    "\n",
