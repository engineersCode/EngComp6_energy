    "\n",
    "In the study of Thermodynamics, mass is neither created nor destroyed; it is a *conserved* quantity.  How does this property manifest itself in the analysis of a thermodynamic system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at a specific example.  The following is a diagram of a thermodynamic cycle involved in the production of electricity.  Water is pumped to a high pressure, where it is then boiled using heat from burning fossil fuels or nuclear fission.  This high pressure steam passes through a turbine, a series of fan blades that rotate a generator to produce electricity.  The steam exits the turbine at a low pressure, and is then condensed back to liquid water by passing it over tubes filled with cold river water.  The liquid water is then pumped back to high pressure, and the cycle repeats itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will develop code for analyzing each of the four devices (pump, boiler, turbine, and condenser).  In later lessons, we will see how to design these devices for maximum efficiency while meeting other design constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's zoom in on the pump.  The diagram labels the inlet (1) and the outlet (2) of the pump in the cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/ideal gas turbine ex.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "When we analyze the pump (or any other device in this cycle), we can't use the idea of a \"control system\" anymore.  Recall that the control system is a defined amount of substance, and if the substance expands or compresses, like in a piston-cylinder, the boundary of the control system moves with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a pump, fluid is constantly entering and leaving the pump.  Defining a control system this way would be impossible because we would have to keep track of where every particle goes during the process.  Some may escape the pump outlet and some may circulate inside.  Another difficulty is that the properties of the system would vary with respect to time as it flows from the pump to the boiler and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "A much easier way to analyze the system is to consider a fixed region of space, in this case the pump itself.  Defining a region of space on which to analyze is called **control volume** analysis.  The boundary of the control volume is again called the **control surface** or **control bounary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at the following diagram of the pump, with the control volume and control surface labeled:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/pump cv.png\" width=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like the boundary of a control system, energy is allowed to transfer across in the form of work and heat.  For the pump, we usually assume it is well insulated, so heat loss is minimal, and the work transfer is via the rotating shaft that pumps the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, unlike the control system, mass is allowed to flow across the boundary.  The rate at which this occurs is called the **mass flow rate** and is labeled $\\dot{m}$ and has units of $kg/s$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this term to write the **conservation of mass** for this control volume.  Using the analogy of a checking account, the rate of money going in minus the rate of money going out equals the rate of change of the amount of money in the account.  Writing this for the control volume for the pump, we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{m}_1 - \\dot{m}_2 = \\dot{m}_{CV}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\dot{m}_1$ is the mass flow rate going into the **inlet** at point 1, $\\dot{m}_2$ is the mass flow rate going into the **outlet** at point 2, and $\\dot{m}_{CV}$ is the rate of change of mass in the control volume (the pump).\n",
    "\n",
    "In most thermodynamic analyses of flow devices like pumps, turbines, boilers, etc. we assume the devices are operating in steady state.  This is very common since most of these cycles are meant to operate in steady state, other than brief start-up and shut-down periods.  With this assumption, we can say that mass of fluid inside the pump is constant, so it is entering and leaving at the same rate.  This means $\\dot{m}_{CV} = 0$, and so we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\dot{m}_1 = \\dot{m}_2$\n",
    "\n",

    "$\\sum\\limits_\\text{inlets} \\dot{m} = \\sum\\limits_\\text{outlets} \\dot{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "however, in most cases there is just one inlet and one outlet.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can relate the mass flow rate $\\dot{m}$ to other familiar variables.  The mass flow rate, by definition, is the mass of fluid passing through a specific point, call it $x_0$, per unit time.  This is depicted in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",

    "In the time interval $t$ to $t + \\Delta t$, some volume of fluid $V$ passes through the point $x = x_0$.  Let's say this volume has cross-sectional area $A$ and length $L$.  Then $V = AL$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is $L$?  If the fluid is flowing with a velocity $\\mathscr{v}$, then it moves forward a distance $\\mathscr{v} \\Delta t$.  So all of the fluid within a distance of $\\mathscr{v} \\Delta t$ crosses the point $x = x_0$ during this time step.  That means $L = \\mathscr{v} \\Delta t$!\n",
