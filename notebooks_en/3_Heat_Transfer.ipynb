This happens even faster if we try to drink it outside on a cold day.  We can slow this down by using an insulated thermos, but this is only delaying the inevitable.\n",

    "### What is Heat Transfer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to any definitions, let's think about what happens when something hot is brought into contact with something cold.  Even if you don't know exactly what temperature is (other than a number on a scale), we know what happens when something hot touches something cold: the hot body gets colder and the cold body gets hotter until they reach the same temperature somewhere between their starting temperatures.  This final temperature is a *stable equilibrium*, meaning there will be no more changes in temperature after this point unless acted on by an outside force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a look at an animation showing a cold gas and a hot gas, initially separated but then allowed to mix together:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/gas heat transfer.gif\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The red bars on the left show the total kinetic energy $\\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ of the particles at that vertical position.  Initially, the bars in the upper half are all longer than the ones in the lower half, indicating that the particles in the top half are moving faster on average.  One the two gases mix, the distribution of kinetic energy quickly becomes uniform from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior matches what we see at the macro scale: a hot liquid and a cold liquid reaching some equilibrium in the middle once they are allowed to mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This animation seems plausible for liquids and gases, where the particles move around randomly and are allowed to mix.  But what about solids?  The following animation shows that a similar phenomenon happens when two solids are brought in contact:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/solid heat transfer.gif\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, the high velocity particles all start in the upper half, then quickly the kinetic energy becomes evenly distributed throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we define **temperature** as the **average kinetic energy** of the particles in a substance, then the behavior we see at the macro scale matches the behavior we see in these animations of the microscale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following plot shows the temperature change over time of a hot body in contact with a cold body, normalized on a scale from 0 to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/temperature vs time.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, this is the exact same behavior we see with the red bars in either animation: their average height converges to a value in the middle of their starting points, then does not change anymore over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Energy is conserved in these simulations; all particle collisions are elastic, and the springs have no damping or friction.  But if we consider the top and bottom halves before and after the contact, the total kinetic energy in the top half goes down and the bottom half goes up.  So we can say that some energy moves from the top half to the bottom half and does not move back.  This energy that is transfered is what we call \"heat\".  **Heat is the energy exchanged between a hot substance and a cold substance.**  Note that when the two halves reach equilibrium (i.e. the same temperature), no more heat is transfered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this heat transfer happens automatically; there are no external forces, moments, or sources of energy driving it.  However, it would require quite a bit of effort to undo the mixing and get all the fast particles to the top half and all the slow ones to the bottom half.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us back to the hot cup of coffee.  It costs nothing to cool the cup back to room temperature; that happens automatically as the two animations show.   But you will never see a room-temperature cup of coffee spontaneously heat itself up while cooling the room down.  It does take energy to heat the coffee back up again.  But how much energy does it take?"

    "\n",
    "The capacity for materials to store energy and transfer heat is an inhertent property of their chemical and structural composition.  For example, it takes about 45 mintues to cook a 1 pound baked potato in the oven, but 1 pound of broccoli can be steamed in about 10 minutes.  On the flip side, the baked potato will stay hot for longer than the broccoli once they are on your plate.  In addition, different cooking methods transfer heat at different rates: baking is generally slower than boiling, which is generally slower than microwaving.  So a combination of how energy is transferred and energy is stored in different substances determines how quickly they heat up or cool down.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first example, we will remove time from the equation and just try to estimate how much energy it takes to heat a cup of coffee from room temperature ($T_1 = 20 ^\\circ C$) to a hot drinking temperature ($T_2 = 60 ^\\circ C$).  Intuitively, the energy required to heat the coffee is just the difference in kinetic energy the coffee molecules have before and after the heating.\n",

As we defined above, heat transfer is the energy transferred to or from a system due to a difference in temperature with its environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way energy is transfered is through **work**, $W$, which in this module will mean mechanical work.  In Thermodynamics applications, this is usually pushing a piston, like in a car engine, or turning a turbine, like in a power plant.  (More on work in the next lesson.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these variables, we can rewrite the energy balance as\n",

    "* $W > 0$.  Work is done by the system.  For example, a system consisting of water flowing through a turbine does work on the rotating shaft.\n",
    "* $W < 0$.  Work is done on the system.  For example, a fan does work on a system consising of air in a ventilation duct.\n",

    "\n",
    "$Q = \\Delta E_{sys}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, at this point, we know that the heat transfered into the system is equal to the change in the system's energy.  But how does a change in the systems energy translate into a change in temperature?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must break down what we mean by a \"system's energy\".  This is typically done in the following fashion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta E_{sys} = \\Delta U + \\Delta KE + \\Delta PE + \\dotsb$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\Delta U$ is the change in energy associated with the random motion of the system's particles, which typically has components of translation, rotation, and vibration.  Unless we knew the exact position and velocity of every particle, we can't actually calculate this.  Instead, it is inferred from experiments, for example, by heating a liquid with a known amount of energy!\n",
    "* $\\Delta KE$ is the change in kinetic energy of the overall system, also known as the \"bulk motion\".  The cup of coffee is not moving with respect to the earth (inertial frame), so $\\Delta KE = 0$ in our example.\n",
    "* $\\Delta PE$ is the change in potential energy of the overall system.  For example, this is significant in a hydroelectric dam, where the water falls a great distance before turning the turbines in the dam.  In our example, the cup is stationary, so there are no changes in potential energy, so $\\Delta PE = 0$.\n",
    "* In general, there may be other terms, like a change in electrical or magnetic potential energy, but we will not consider any of these other forms in these lessons.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, our energy balance reduces to\n",

    "$Q = \\Delta U$\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate at which a change in the internal energy translates into a change in temperature is given by\n",

Note the word \"specific\" again indicates a per-mass basis, just like specific volume.  The subscript \"v\" indicates that the volume is held constant as the temperature changes.  For liquids and solids, this is usually the case (see \"Incompressible Liquids\" in the previous lesson).\n",
